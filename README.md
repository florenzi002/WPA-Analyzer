# WPA2-Analyzer

This project is the final project of the **Network Security** course @ *Universit√† degli Studi di Brescia*

## Description
Proof of concept of the fact that, in a WPA2-PSK enviroment, knowing the PSK and snooping a succesful handshake, a 3rd party is able to derive the same PTK as a legitimate client and decrypt the whole session between STA and AP.

## Assumption
The software makes a few assumptions:
 - The session is encrypted using WPA2-PSK (AES CCMP & HMAC SHA1)
 -  We know the PSK
 - All the packets have a PRISM header [144 byte]

## Usage
The software can be compiled using CMake. 
Once compiled run:

    ./wpa_decode captured_traffic_file decrypted_traffic_destination_file SSID WLAN-PWD

where

 - *captured_traffic_file* is a pcap file of snooped traffic
 - *decrypted_traffic_destination_file* is the path of the file which will hold the decrypted traffic
 - *ssid* is the SSID of the WLAN which traffic we want to decrypt
 - *pwd* is the password of the WLAN which SSID is specified as *ssid* parameter
 
 once the software is done with the decryption it is easy to see, inspecting the *decrypted_traffic_destination_file* i.e
 through *tcpdump* or *wireshark*, that information at layer 3 and above are exposed or, at most, protected by
 respective security protocols.

 
## Prerequisites
The machine is running on UNIX and has **OpenSSL** libraries and **pcap** libraries installed  

## Limitation
The software is focused on decrypting unicast traffic in either direction and doesn't care about multicast traffic.
